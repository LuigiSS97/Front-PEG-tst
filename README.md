\_\_Teste PEG contas - Luigi Souza Scipioni

Greetings, PEG HR team. At first, i would like to express how grateful I feel to have the oportunity to be challenged and participate to the recruitment process. I've been working hard for the last ten days in this project and I feel content, because I feel that it was a great oportunitty improve myself as a developer.

Below, i will tell you guys how to access the project and run it.

I really hope that you enjoy the result of my trully effort!

\_\_Introduction

Developing this project, i concentrated myself to prioritize the features that demanded end-point's interaction as much as the design. At the limited time of ten days, I aimed to:

-Do the most responsive design as possible, respecting all the coding conventions. -Show the process of development trough the commits, such as linear and logical stages of development -Make the components to interact to each other to make a clean and readable code, as well as make it easy to understand the cooperation between the components

\_\_Architecture

I used React Js as framework to state managing and used the hooks to make a clean code. In addition to it, i used some libs: axios,json server, json, react router.

\_\_About some design choices

I first noted that the .jpg of the test goal wasn't a widescreen printscreen, so I decided to make a grid of four columns instead of three, with the intention to improve de user experience by making the content fit in the 16:9 screens. As a second decision, I made a separated component to the card board, to make it better to customize and to avoid huge amount of code lines in a single file.

\_\_Follow the recommendations below to run the project

-at the vs terminal run: cd front-test

-git bash at ./server and run: yarn start / npm start

-at the vs terminal run: yarn start

\_\_Conclusion

The following bonus requirements were accomplished -- Layout responsiveness; -- Select of activities; -- Use some state managing solution; --Pagination

I chose not to implement the filtering ["Prioridade(SLA)" and "Receber documentos"] because of lack of time, my main professional objective is to become more efficient by studying and working as a developer. I really believe that maximum effort can make my life better, so I decided to study front-end developing, which became my passion, and apply to this opportunitty.

Once again, thank you!
